FURTHER MAC APP STORE AND APP STORE TERMS AND CONDITIONS

LICENSE OF MAC APP STORE AND APP STORE PRODUCTS

iTunes is selling you a licence to use the software products made available=
 through the Mac App Store and App Store (collectively, the =E2=80=9CApp St=
ore Products=E2=80=9D). There are two (2) categories of App Store Products,=
 as follows: (i) those App Store Products that have been developed by Apple=
, and which are licensed to you by iTunes (=E2=80=9CApple Products=E2=80=9D=
); and (ii) those App Store Products that have been developed, and are lice=
nsed to you, by a third-party developer (=E2=80=9CThird-Party Products=E2=
=80=9D). The category of a particular App Store Product (Apple Product or T=
hird-Party Product) is identified on the Mac App Store Application or App S=
tore application.

Your license to each App Store Product is subject to the Licensed Applicati=
on End User License Agreement set forth below, and you agree that such term=
s will apply unless the App Store Product is covered by a valid end user li=
cense agreement entered into between you and the publisher of that App Stor=
e Product (the =E2=80=9CPublisher=E2=80=9D), in which case the Publisher=E2=
=80=99s end user license agreement will apply to that App Store Product. Th=
e Publisher reserves all rights in and to the App Store Product not express=
ly granted to you.

You acknowledge that the license you purchase to each Apple Product that yo=
u obtain through the Mac App Store or App Store is a binding agreement betw=
een you and iTunes. You acknowledge that: once you purchase a Third-Party P=
roduct from iTunes, you are entering into a binding agreement directly with=
 the Publisher of that Third-Party Product governing your use of that Third=
-Party Product; and iTunes is not a party to the license between you and th=
e Publisher with respect to that Third-Party Product. The Publisher of each=
 Third-Party Product is solely responsible for that Third-Party Product, th=
e content therein, any warranties to the extent that such warranties have n=
ot been disclaimed, and any claims that you or any other party may have rel=
ating to that Third-Party Product.

You acknowledge and agree that iTunes and its affiliates are third-party be=
neficiaries of the Licensed Application End User License Agreement or the P=
ublisher=E2=80=99s end user license agreement, as the case may be, for each=
 Third-Party Product. You also agree that, upon your acceptance of the term=
s and conditions of the license to any such Third-Party Product, iTunes wil=
l have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce=
 such license against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.

IN-APP PURCHASES

Certain App Store Products may include functionality that enables you to pu=
rchase additional services, or licenses to additional functionality or cont=
ent for use within the App Store Product ("In App Purchases"). In App Purch=
ases that are consumed during the use of the App Store Product (for example=
, virtual ammunition) cannot be transferred among devices; can be downloade=
d only once; and after being downloaded, cannot be replaced. Once a consuma=
ble In App Purchase is purchased and received by you, iTunes shall be witho=
ut liability to you in the event of any loss, destruction, or damage. All I=
n App Purchases are deemed App Store Products, and In App Purchases made wi=
thin Third-Party Products are deemed Third-Party Products, and treated as s=
uch, for purposes of these terms and conditions.

In-App Purchases must be authenticated separately by entering your password=
 when prompted, but once you have authenticated In-App Purchases, you will =
be able to make additional In-App Purchases for fifteen minutes without re-=
entering your password.  You can turn off the ability to make In-App Purcha=

tlined at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4213.

IN-APP SUBSCRIPTIONS

Certain App Store Products may include functionality that enables you to pu=
rchase content on a subscription basis (=E2=80=9CPaid Subscriptions=E2=80=
=9D). Paid Subscriptions will automatically renew for the applicable time p=
eriod you have selected, and your Account will be charged no more than 24-h=
ours prior to the expiration of the current Paid Subscription. You may canc=
el automatic renewal by selecting Manage App Subscriptions in your Account =
and selecting the subscription you want to modify. The auto-renew feature o=
f the subscription will be turned off if the Publisher increases the price =
of the subscription. Certain Paid Subscriptions may offer a free trial prio=
r to purchase. If you decide to purchase a Paid Subscription prior to the e=
nd of the free trial period, your Paid Subscription will start immediately.=
 You should also review additional information about the Paid Subscription =
offer at the point of sale within the App Store Product. We may ask for you=
r permission to provide the name, email address and postcode listed in your=
 Account to the Publisher so that the Publisher can send you marketing mess=
ages about its own products in accordance with its privacy policy. Once the=
 Publisher has this information, it will be treated in accordance with the =
Publisher's publicly posted privacy policy. We encourage you to learn about=
 the privacy practices of the Publisher before agreeing to give it your per=
sonal information. For more information, please review the Publisher's priv=
acy policy or contact the Publisher directly. Refunds (which will be pro-ra=
ted to take into account content included in the Paid Subscription that you=
 have already received) are available within 14 calendar days of purchase o=

roduct that you license through the App Stores, unless that App Store Produ=
ct is covered by a valid end user licence agreement entered into between yo=

hat separate end user licence agreement will govern. Your licence to any Ap=
ple Product under this Standard EULA or separate end user licence agreement=
 is granted by iTunes, and your licence to any Third-Party Product under th=
is Standard EULA or separate end user licence agreement is granted by the P=
ublisher of that Third-Party Product. Any App Store Product that is subject=
 to the licence granted under this Standard EULA is referred to herein as t=
he =E2=80=9CLicensed Application=E2=80=9D. Publisher or iTunes as applicabl=
e (the =E2=80=9CLicensor=E2=80=9D) reserves all rights in and to the Licens=
ed Application not expressly granted to you under this Standard EULA.

a. Scope of License: This licence granted to you for the Licensed Applicati=

 to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable l=
aw or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing us=
e of any open-sourced components included with the Licensed Application). A=
ny attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of the Licensor and its li=
censors. If you breach this restriction, you may be subject to prosecution =
and damages.

The terms of this licence will govern any upgrades provided by Licensor tha=
t replace and/or supplement the original Licensed Application, unless such =

hnical information about your device, system and application software, and =

ies professional who is legally qualified to give financial or securities a=

vice is for basic navigational purposes only and is not intended to be reli=
ed on in situations where precise location information is needed or where e=
rroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may lead to =
death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. Neither the Li=
censor, its agents nor any of its content providers guarantees the availabi=
lity, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of stock informati=
on, location data or any other data displayed by any External Services.

You agree that the External Services contain proprietary content, informati=
on and material that is owned by Licensor and/or its agents or licensors, a=
nd is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, includi=
ng but not limited to copyright, and that you will not use such proprietary=

ed use of the External Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with =
the terms of this Standard EULA or that infringes any intellectual property=
 rights of a third party, iTunes or Apple. No portion of the External Servi=
ces may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify,=
 rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on t=
he External Services in any manner, and you shall not exploit the External =

, abuse, stalk, threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the right=
s of any other party, and that neither Licensor nor its agents are in any w=
ay responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening,=
 defamatory, offensive, infringing or illegal messages or transmissions tha=
t you may receive as a result of using any of the External Services.

In addition, External Services and Third Party Materials that may be access=
ed from, displayed on or linked to from the Apple Devices are not available=
 in all languages or in all countries or regions. The Licensor makes no rep=
resentation that such External Services and Materials are appropriate or av=
ailable for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use=
 or access such External Services and Materials, you do so at your own init=
iative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, includi=
ng but not limited to applicable local laws. Licensor reserves the right to=
 change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any External Services at any=
 time without notice. In no event will the Licensor be liable for the remov=
al of or disabling of access to any such External Services. The Licensor ma=

 the provision of the Licensed Application and any External Services perfor=
med or provided by the Licensed Application to you. Licensor does not make =

lar does not warrant that:

D. PRIVACY POLICY

Your privacy is important to Apple. So we=E2=80=99ve developed a Privacy Po=
licy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your in=
formation. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy pr=
actices and let us know if you have any questions.

Collection and Use of Personal Information

Personal information is data that can be used to uniquely identify or conta=
ct a single person.

You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in co=
ntact with Apple or an Apple affiliated company. Apple and its affiliates m=
ay share this personal information with each other and use it consistent wi=
th this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to =
provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.

Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may colle=
ct and how we may use it.

What personal information we collect

=E2=96=A0=09When you create an Apple ID, register your products, apply for =
commercial credit, purchase a product, download a software update, register=
 for a class at an Apple Retail Store, or participate in an online survey, =
we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing addre=
ss, phone number, email address, contact preferences, and credit card infor=
mation.

=E2=96=A0=09When you share your content with family and friends using Apple=
 products, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to join yo=
u on Apple forums, Apple may collect the information you provide about thos=
e people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.

=E2=96=A0=09In the U.S., we may ask for your Social Security number (SSN) b=
ut only in limited circumstances such as when setting up a wireless account=
 and activating your iPhone or when determining whether to extend commercia=
l credit.

How we use your personal information

=E2=96=A0=09The personal information we collect allows us to keep you poste=
d on Apple=E2=80=99s latest product announcements, software updates, and up=
coming events. It also helps us to improve our services, content, and adver=
tising. If you don=E2=80=99t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt ou=
t anytime by updating your preferences.

=E2=96=A0=09We also use personal information to help us develop, deliver, a=
nd improve our products, services, content, and advertising.

=E2=96=A0=09From time to time, we may use your personal information to send=
 important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to o=
ur terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important t=
o your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these commu=
nications.

=E2=96=A0=09We may also use personal information for internal purposes such=
 as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Apple=E2=80=99s produc=
ts, services, and customer communications.

=E2=96=A0=09If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion w=
e may use the information you provide to administer those programs.

Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information

We also collect non-personal information =E2=88=92 data in a form that does=
 not permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect=
, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The=
 following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect an=
d how we may use it:

=E2=96=A0=09We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip co=
de, area code, unique device identifier, location, and the time zone where =
an Apple product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior=
 and improve our products, services, and advertising.

=E2=96=A0=09We also may collect information regarding customer activities o=
n our website, MobileMe service, and iTunes Store and from our other produc=
ts and services. This information is aggregated and used to help us provide=
 more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of =
our website, products, and services are of most interest. Aggregated data i=
s considered non-personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Poli=
cy.

If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the com=
bined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it=
 remains combined.

Cookies and Other Technologies

Apple=E2=80=99s website, online services, interactive applications, email m=
essages, and advertisements may use =E2=80=9Ccookies=E2=80=9D and other tec=
hnologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us be=
tter understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our website people ha=
ve visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements =
and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other techn=
ologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet P=
rotocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal infor=
mation by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal informatio=
n. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with =
personal information, we treat the combined information as personal informa=
tion for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.

Apple and its partners use cookies and other technologies in mobile adverti=
sing services to control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ad=
s that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campai=
gns. If you do not want to receive ads with this level of relevance on your=
 mobile device, you can opt out by accessing the following link on your dev=
ice: http://oo.apple.com. If you opt out, you will continue to receive the =
same number of mobile ads, but they may be less relevant because they will =
not be based on your interests. You may still see ads related to the conten=
t on a web page or in an application or based on other non-personal informa=
tion. This opt-out applies only to Apple advertising services and does not =
affect interest-based advertising from other advertising networks.

Apple and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember =
personal information when you use our website, online services, and applica=
tions. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with Apple more c=
onvenient and personal. For example, knowing your first name lets us welcom=
e you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store. Knowing your country =
and language =E2=88=92 and if you are an educator, your school =E2=88=92 he=
lps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience. Knowing so=
meone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or us=
ed a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communicati=
ons more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information, =
product serial numbers, and information about your computer or device helps=
 us register your products, personalize your operating system, set up your =
MobileMe service, and provide you with better customer service.

If you want to disable cookies and you=E2=80=99re using the Safari web brow=
ser, go to Safari preferences and then to the Security pane to disable cook=
ies. On your Apple mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, and then to =
the Cookies section. For other browsers, check with your provider to find o=
ut how to disable cookies. Please note that certain features of the Apple w=
ebsite will not be available once cookies are disabled.

As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and s=
tore it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addr=
esses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referrin=
g and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the=
 site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic =
information about our user base as a whole. Apple may use this information =
in our marketing and advertising services.

In some of our email messages, we use a =E2=80=9Cclick-through URL=E2=80=9D=
 linked to content on the Apple website. When customers click one of these =
URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destin=
ation page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us dete=
rmine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our cu=
stomer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you sho=
uld not click text or graphic links in the email messages.

Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read,=
 and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information=
 to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.

Disclosure to Third Parties

At times Apple may make certain personal information available to strategic=
 partners that work with Apple to provide products and services, or that he=
lp Apple market to customers. For example, when you purchase and activate y=
our iPhone, you authorise Apple and its carrier to exchange the information=
 you provide during the activation process to carry out service. If you are=
 approved for service, your account will be governed by Apple and its carri=
er=E2=80=99s respective privacy policies. Personal information will only be=
 shared by Apple to provide or improve our products, services and advertisi=
ng; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.

Service Providers

Apple shares personal information with companies who provide services such =
as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, de=
livering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing c=
ustomer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and =
conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are o=
bligated to protect your information and may be located wherever Apple oper=
ates.

Others
