OU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT CLICK &#34;AGREE,&#34; AND DO NOT US=
E THE ITUNES STORE, MAC APP STORE, APP STORE OR IBOOKSTORE. THIS AGREEMENT =
APPLIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO SOFTWARE LICENCES THAT YOU MAY HAVE ENTERED IN=
TO, SUCH AS FOR THE USE OF THE ITUNES APPLICATION.<br>
<br>
A. ITUNES STORE, MAC APP STORE, APP STORE AND IBOOKSTORE TERMS OF SALE<br>
<br>
PAYMENTS, TAXES, AND REFUND POLICY<br>
<br>
The iTunes Store, Mac App Store, App Store and iBookstore services (the =E2=
=80=9CStores=E2=80=9D) accept these forms of payment: credit and debit card=
s issued by banks in the United Kingdom, payments through your Click&amp;Bu=
y account, iTunes Cards, iTunes Store Gift Certificates, Content Codes, and=
 Allowance Account balances. If a credit or debit card or your Click&amp;Bu=
y account is being used for a transaction, iTunes may obtain preapproval fo=
r an amount up to the amount of the order. Billing occurs at the time of or=
 shortly after your transaction. If you are using 1-Click purchasing or you=
r Click&amp;Buy account, your order may be authorised and billed in increme=
nts during one purchasing session, so it may appear as multiple orders on y=
our statement. If an iTunes Card, iTunes Store Gift Certificate, or Allowan=
ce Account is used for a transaction, the amount is deducted at the time of=
 your transaction. When making purchases, content credits are used first, f=
ollowed by Gift Certificate, iTunes Card, or Allowance Account credits; you=
r credit or debit card or Click&amp;Buy account is then charged for any rem=
aining balance.<br>
<br>
You agree that you will pay for all products you purchase through the Store=
s, and that iTunes may charge your credit or debit card or Click&amp;Buy ac=
count for any products purchased and for any additional amounts (including =
any taxes and late fees, as applicable) that may be accrued by or in connec=
tion with your Account. You are responsible for the timely payment of all f=
ees and for providing iTunes with a valid credit or debit card or Click&amp=
;Buy account details for payment of all fees. All fees will be billed to th=
e credit or debit card or Click&amp;Buy account you designate during the re=
gistration process. If you want to designate a different credit or debit ca=
rd or if there is a change in your credit or debit card or Click&amp;Buy ac=
count status, you must change your information online in the Account Inform=
ation section of iTunes; this may temporarily disrupt your access to the St=
ores while iTunes verifies your new payment information.<br>
<br>
Your total price will include the price of the product plus any applicable =
VAT (in effect on the day of download).<br>
<br>
You have the right to withdraw from your transaction without charge and wit=
hout giving any reason until delivery of the product has started. You do no=
t have the right to withdraw from a transaction once delivery of the produc=
t has started at which point your transaction is final. The Store services =
commence immediately when you begin to download a product from the relevant=
 Store and you will not have a right to cancel your contract once the servi=
ce commences unless you have received an unacceptably poor download. If thi=
s happens, you must tell us as soon as possible using the =E2=80=9CReport a=
 Problem=E2=80=9D link in your invoice, and if the poor download is caused =
by iTunes and cannot be resolved, a refund may be provided.<br>

Until a purchase is made, iTunes reserves the right to change prices for pr=
oducts offered via the Stores at any time, and the Stores do not provide pr=
ice protection or refunds in the event of a price reduction or promotional =
offering subsequent to purchase.<br>
<br>
If a product becomes unavailable following a transaction but prior to downl=
oad, your sole remedy is likely to be limited to a refund of the price paid=
 for the unavailable product. If technical problems prevent or unreasonably=
 delay delivery of your product, your exclusive and sole remedy is either r=
eplacement or refund of the price paid, as determined by iTunes.<br>
<br>
1-Click=C2=AE<br>
<br>
1-Click is a registered service mark of Amazon.com, Inc., used under licens=

a the dialog that appears when you click a Buy button. (You may reset this =
selection at any time by clicking Reset Warnings in your Account informatio=
n). When accessing the Stores on your iPad, iPod, or iPhone, 1-Click is act=
ivated for each transaction by tapping the button showing the price of the =
product, which reveals the Buy button. When 1-Click is activated, clicking =
or tapping the Buy button starts the download immediately and completes you=
r transaction without any further steps.<br>

, and which are licensed to you by iTunes (the =E2=80=9CApple Products=E2=
=80=9D); and (ii) those App Store Products that have been developed, and ar=
e licensed to you, by a third-party developer (the =E2=80=9CThird-Party Pro=
ducts=E2=80=9D). The category of a particular App Store Product (Apple Prod=
uct or Third-Party Product) is identified on the Mac App Store Application =
or App Store application.<br>
<br>
Your licence to each App Store Product is subject to the Licensed Applicati=
on End User License Agreement set forth below. You agree that the terms of =
the Licensed Application End User License Agreement will apply to each Appl=
e Product and to each Third-Party Product that you license through the Mac =
App Store or App Store, unless the App Store Product is covered by a valid =
end user licence agreement entered into between you and the publisher of th=
e App Store Product (the =E2=80=9CPublisher=E2=80=9D), in which case the Pu=
blisher=E2=80=99s end user licence agreement will apply to that App Store P=
roduct. The Publisher reserves all rights in and to the App Store Product n=
ot expressly granted to you.<br>
<br>
You acknowledge that the licence you purchase to each Apple Product that yo=
u obtain through the Mac App Store or App Store is a binding agreement betw=
een you and iTunes. You acknowledge that: once you purchase a Third-Party P=
roduct from iTunes, you are entering into a binding agreement directly with=
 the Publisher of that Third-Party Product governing your use of that Third=
-Party Product; and iTunes is not a party to the licence between you and th=
e Publisher with respect to that Third-Party Product. The Publisher of each=
 Third-Party Product is solely responsible for that Third-Party Product, th=
e content therein, any warranties to the extent that such warranties have n=
ot been disclaimed, and any claims that you or any other party may have rel=
ating to that Third-Party Product.<br>
<br>
You acknowledge and agree that iTunes and its affiliates are third-party be=
neficiaries of the Licensed Application End User License Agreement or the P=
ublisher=E2=80=99s end user licence agreement, as the case may be, for each=
 Third-Party Product. You also agree that, upon your acceptance of the term=
s and conditions of the licence to any such Third-Party Product, iTunes wil=
l have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce=
 such licence against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.<br>
<br>
Certain App Store Products may include functionality that enables you to pu=
rchase additional services, or licences to additional functionality or cont=
ent for use within the App Store Product (&#34;In App Purchases&#34;). In A=
pp Purchases that are consumed during the use of the App Store Product (for=
 example, virtual ammunition) cannot be transferred among devices; can be d=
ownloaded only once; and after being downloaded, cannot be replaced. Once a=
 consumable In App Purchase is purchased and received by you, iTunes shall =
be without liability to you in the event of any loss, destruction, or damag=
e. All In App Purchases are deemed App Store Products, and In App Purchases=
 made within Third-Party Products are deemed Third-Party Products, and trea=
ted as such, for purposes of these terms and conditions.<br>

 area code, unique device identifier, location, and the time zone where an =
Apple product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior an=
d improve our products, services, and advertising.<br>
<br>
=E2=96=A0We also may collect information regarding customer activities on o=
ur website, MobileMe service, and iTunes Store and from our other products =
and services. This information is aggregated and used to help us provide mo=
re useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our=
 website, products, and services are of most interest. Aggregated data is c=
onsidered non-personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.=
<br>
<br>
If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the com=
bined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it=
 remains combined.<br>
<br>
Cookies and Other Technologies<br>
<br>
Apple=E2=80=99s website, online services, interactive applications, email m=
essages, and advertisements may use =E2=80=9Ccookies=E2=80=9D and other tec=
hnologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us be=
tter understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our website people ha=
ve visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements =
and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other techn=
ologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet P=
rotocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal infor=
mation by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal informatio=
n. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with =
personal information, we treat the combined information as personal informa=
tion for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
Apple and its partners use cookies and other technologies in mobile adverti=
sing services to control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ad=
s that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campai=
gns. If you do not want to receive ads with this level of relevance on your=
 mobile device, you can opt out by accessing the following link on your dev=
ice: http://oo.apple.com. If you opt out, you will continue to receive the =
same number of mobile ads, but they may be less relevant because they will =
not be based on your interests. You may still see ads related to the conten=
t on a web page or in an application or based on other non-personal informa=
tion. This opt-out applies only to Apple advertising services and does not =
affect interest-based advertising from other advertising networks.<br>
<br>
Apple and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember =
personal information when you use our website, online services, and applica=
tions. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with Apple more c=
onvenient and personal. For example, knowing your first name lets us welcom=
e you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store. Knowing your country =
and language =E2=88=92 and if you are an educator, your school =E2=88=92 he=
lps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience. Knowing so=
meone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or us=
ed a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communicati=
ons more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information, =
product serial numbers, and information about your computer or device helps=
 us register your products, personalize your operating system, set up your =
MobileMe service, and provide you with better customer service.<br>
<br>
If you want to disable cookies and you=E2=80=99re using the Safari web brow=
ser, go to Safari preferences and then to the Security pane to disable cook=
ies. On your Apple mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, and then to =
the Cookies section. For other browsers, check with your provider to find o=
ut how to disable cookies. Please note that certain features of the Apple w=
ebsite will not be available once cookies are disabled.<br>
<br>
As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and s=
tore it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addr=
esses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referrin=
g and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.<=
br>
<br>
We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the=
 site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic =
information about our user base as a whole. Apple may use this information =
in our marketing and advertising services.<br>
<br>
In some of our email messages, we use a =E2=80=9Cclick-through URL=E2=80=9D=
 linked to content on the Apple website. When customers click one of these =
URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destin=
ation page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us dete=
rmine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our cu=
stomer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you sho=
uld not click text or graphic links in the email messages.<br>
<br>
Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read,=
 and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information=
 to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.<br>
<br>
Disclosure to Third Parties<br>
<br>
At times Apple may make certain personal information available to strategic=
 partners that work with Apple to provide products and services, or that he=
lp Apple market to customers. For example, when you purchase and activate y=
our iPhone, you authorise Apple and its carrier to exchange the information=
 you provide during the activation process to carry out service. If you are=
 approved for service, your account will be governed by Apple and its carri=
er=E2=80=99s respective privacy policies. Personal information will only be=
 shared by Apple to provide or improve our products, services and advertisi=
ng; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.<=
br>
<br>
Service Providers<br>
<br>
Apple shares personal information with companies who provide services such =
as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, de=
livering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing c=
ustomer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and =
conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are o=
bligated to protect your information and may be located wherever Apple oper=
ates.<br>
<br>
Others<br>
<br>
It may be necessary =E2=88=92 by law, legal process, litigation, and/or req=
uests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your count=
ry of residence =E2=88=92 for Apple to disclose your personal information. =
We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purpose=
s of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importan=
ce, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.<br>
<br>
We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure =
is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our =
operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger=
, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to th=
e relevant third party.<br>
<br>
Protection of Personal Information<br>
<br>
Apple takes precautions =E2=80=94 including administrative, technical, and =
physical measures =E2=80=94 to safeguard your personal information against =
loss, theft, and misuse, as well as against unauthorised access, disclosure=
, alteration, and destruction.<br>
<br>
Apple online services such as the Apple Online Store and iTunes Store use S=
ecure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal inform=
ation is collected. To make purchases from these services, you must use an =
SSL-enabled browser such as Safari, Firefox, or Internet Explorer. Doing so=
 protects the confidentiality of your personal information while it=E2=80=
=99s transmitted over the Internet.<br>
<br>
When you use some Apple products, services, or applications or post on an A=
pple forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal informati=
on you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used =
by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to sub=
mit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email addres=
s in a forum posting, that information is public. Please take care when usi=
ng these features.<br>
<br>
Integrity and Retention of Personal Information<br>
<br>
Apple makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, com=
plete, and up to date. We will retain your personal information for the per=
iod necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unles=
s a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.<br>
<br>
Access to Personal Information<br>
<br>
You can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accur=
ate, complete, and up to date by logging in to your account at www.apple.co=
m/contact/myinfo. For other personal information, we make good faith effort=
s to provide you with access so you can request that we correct the data if=
 it is inaccurate or delete the data if Apple is not required to retain it =
by law or for legitimate business purposes. We may decline to process reque=
sts that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical ef=
fort, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for w=
hich access is not otherwise required by local law. Access, correction, or =
deletion requests can be made to the regional Privacy email addresses.<br>
<br>
Children<br>
<br>
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If=
 we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under =
13 we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
Location-Based Services<br>
<br>
To provide location-based services on Apple products, Apple and our partner=
s and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, includin=
g the real-time geographic location of your Apple computer or device. This =
location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally i=
dentify you and is used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide =
and improve location-based products and services. For example, we may share=
 geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their lo=
cation services.<br>
<br>
Some location-based services offered by Apple, such as the MobileMe =E2=80=
=9CFind My iPhone=E2=80=9D feature, require your personal information for t=
he feature to work.<br>
<br>
Third-Party Sites and Services<br>
<br>
Apple websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to t=
hird-party websites, products, and services. Our products and services may =
also use or offer products or services from third parties =E2=88=92 for exa=
mple, a third-party iPhone app. Information collected by third parties, whi=
ch may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed=
 by their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy pr=
actices of those third parties.<br>

he world as described in this Privacy Policy. Apple abides by the =E2=80=9C=
