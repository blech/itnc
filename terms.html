ards issued by banks in the United Kingdom, payments through your Click&Buy=
 account, iTunes Cards, iTunes Store Gift Certificates, Content Codes, and =
Allowance Account balances. If a credit or debit card or your Click&Buy acc=
ount is being used for a transaction, iTunes may obtain preapproval for an =
amount up to the amount of the order. Billing occurs at the time of or shor=
tly after your transaction. If you are using 1-Click purchasing or your Cli=
ck&Buy account, your order may be authorised and billed in increments durin=
g one purchasing session, so it may appear as multiple orders on your state=
ment. If an iTunes Card, iTunes Store Gift Certificate, or Allowance Accoun=
t is used for a transaction, the amount is deducted at the time of your tra=
nsaction. When making purchases, content credits are used first, followed b=
y Gift Certificate, iTunes Card, or Allowance Account credits; your credit =
or debit card or Click&Buy account is then charged for any remaining balanc=
e.<br>
<br>
You agree that you will pay for all products you purchase through the Store=
s, and that iTunes may charge your credit or debit card or Click&Buy accoun=
t for any products purchased and for any additional amounts (including any =

 with your Account. You are responsible for the timely payment of all fees =
and for providing iTunes with a valid credit or debit card or Click&Buy acc=
ount details for payment of all fees. All fees will be billed to the credit=

rocess. If you want to designate a different credit or debit card or if the=
re is a change in your credit or debit card or Click&Buy account status, yo=
u must change your information online in the Account Information section of=
 iTunes; this may temporarily disrupt your access to the Stores while iTune=

ad. If this happens, you must tell us as soon as possible using the =E2=80=

If a product becomes unavailable following a transaction but prior to downl=
oad, your sole remedy is likely to be limited to a refund of the price paid=
 for the unavailable product. If technical problems prevent or unreasonably=
 delay delivery of your product, your exclusive and sole remedy is either r=
eplacement or refund of the price paid, as determined by iTunes.<br>

FURTHER MAC APP STORE AND APP STORE TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
LICENSE OF MAC APP STORE AND APP STORE PRODUCTS<br>
<br>
iTunes is selling you a licence to use the software products made available=
 through the Mac App Store and App Store (collectively, the =E2=80=9CApp St=
ore Products=E2=80=9D). There are two (2) categories of App Store Products,=
 as follows: (i) those App Store Products that have been developed by Apple=
, and which are licensed to you by iTunes (=E2=80=9CApple Products=E2=80=9D=
); and (ii) those App Store Products that have been developed, and are lice=
nsed to you, by a third-party developer (=E2=80=9CThird-Party Products=E2=
=80=9D). The category of a particular App Store Product (Apple Product or T=
hird-Party Product) is identified on the Mac App Store Application or App S=
tore application.<br>
<br>
Your license to each App Store Product is subject to the Licensed Applicati=
on End User License Agreement set forth below, and you agree that such term=
s will apply unless the App Store Product is covered by a valid end user li=
cense agreement entered into between you and the publisher of that App Stor=
e Product (the =E2=80=9CPublisher=E2=80=9D), in which case the Publisher=E2=
=80=99s end user license agreement will apply to that App Store Product. Th=
e Publisher reserves all rights in and to the App Store Product not express=
ly granted to you.<br>
<br>
You acknowledge that the license to each Apple Product that you obtain thro=
ugh the Mac App Store or App Store is a binding agreement between you and i=
Tunes. You acknowledge that: once you acquire a Third-Party Product from iT=
unes, you are entering into a binding agreement directly with the Publisher=
 of that Third-Party Product governing your use of that Third-Party Product=
; and iTunes is not a party to the license between you and the Publisher wi=
th respect to that Third-Party Product. The Publisher of each Third-Party P=
roduct is solely responsible for that Third-Party Product, the content ther=
ein, any warranties to the extent that such warranties have not been discla=
imed, and any claims that you or any other party may have relating to that =
Third-Party Product.<br>
<br>
You acknowledge and agree that iTunes and its affiliates are third-party be=
neficiaries of the Licensed Application End User License Agreement or the P=
ublisher=E2=80=99s end user license agreement, as the case may be, for each=
 Third-Party Product. You also agree that, upon your acceptance of the term=
s and conditions of the license to any such Third-Party Product, iTunes wil=
l have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce=
 such license against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.<br>
<br>
IN-APP PURCHASES<br>
<br>
Certain App Store Products may include functionality that enables you to re=
ceive additional services, or licenses to additional functionality or conte=
nt for use within the App Store Product (&#34;In App Purchases&#34;). In Ap=
p Purchases that are consumed during the use of the App Store Product (for =
example, virtual ammunition) cannot be transferred among devices; can be do=
wnloaded only once; and after being downloaded, cannot be replaced. Once a =
consumable In App Purchase is acquired and received by you, iTunes shall be=
 without liability to you in the event of any loss, destruction, or damage.=
 All In-App Purchases are deemed App Store Products, and In App Purchases r=
eceived within Third-Party Products are deemed Third-Party Products, and tr=
eated as such, for purposes of these terms and conditions.<br>
<br>
You must authenticate to acquire In-App Purchases separately from any authe=
ntication to obtain App Store Products by entering your password when promp=
ted, but once you have authenticated to obtain an In-App Purchase, you will=
 be able to acquire additional In-App Purchases for fifteen minutes without=
 re-entering your password. You can turn off the ability to acquire In-App =
Purchases on your iOS Device by going to your Settings, selecting =E2=80=9C=
General=E2=80=9D and then selecting the =E2=80=9CRestrictions=E2=80=9D tab,=
 as outlined at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4213.<br>
<br>
IN-APP SUBSCRIPTIONS<br>
<br>
Certain App Store Products may include functionality that enables you to ac=
quire content on a subscription basis (=E2=80=9CIn-App Subscriptions=E2=80=
=9D). In-App Subscriptions will automatically renew for the applicable time=
 period you have selected and, where applicable, your Account will be charg=
ed no more than 24-hours prior to the expiration of the current In-App Subs=
cription. You may cancel automatic renewal of paid In-App Subscriptions by =
selecting Manage App Subscriptions in your Account and selecting the subscr=
iption you want to modify. The auto-renew feature of the subscription will =
be turned off if the Publisher increases the price of the subscription. You=
 may cancel free In-App Subscriptions by deleting the App Store Product fro=
m your device. Certain paid In-App Subscriptions may offer a free trial pri=
or to purchase. If you decide to purchase a paid In-App Subscription prior =
to the end of the free trial period, your paid In-App Subscription will sta=
rt immediately. Certain In-App Subscriptions may be designated as =E2=80=9C=
Newsstand=E2=80=9D products, in which case they will appear only within the=
 Newsstand application on your device after download. You should also revie=
w additional information about the paid In-App Subscription offer at the po=
int of sale within the App Store Product. We may ask for your permission to=
 provide the name, email address and postcode listed in your Account to the=
 Publisher so that the Publisher can send you marketing messages about its =
own products in accordance with its privacy policy. Once the Publisher has =
this information, it will be treated in accordance with the Publisher&#39;s=
 publicly posted privacy policy. We encourage you to learn about the privac=
y practices of the Publisher before agreeing to give it your personal infor=
mation. For more information, please review the Publisher&#39;s privacy pol=
icy or contact the Publisher directly. Refunds (which will be pro-rated to =
take into account content included in the In-App Subscription that you have=
 already received) are available within 14 calendar days of purchase of the=
 In-App Subscription by completing the e-mail form available at http://www.=
apple.com/uk/support/itunes/. No other refunds, returns or cancellations af=
ter purchase.<br>

D. PRIVACY POLICY<br>
<br>
Your privacy is important to Apple. So we=E2=80=99ve developed a Privacy Po=
licy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your in=
formation. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy pr=
actices and let us know if you have any questions.<br>
<br>
Collection and Use of Personal Information<br>
<br>
Personal information is data that can be used to uniquely identify or conta=
ct a single person.<br>
<br>
You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in co=
ntact with Apple or an Apple affiliated company. Apple and its affiliates m=
ay share this personal information with each other and use it consistent wi=
th this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to =
provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.<br>
<br>
Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may colle=
ct and how we may use it.<br>
<br>
What personal information we collect<br>
<br>
=E2=96=A0When you create an Apple ID, register your products, apply for com=
mercial credit, purchase a product, download a software update, register fo=
r a class at an Apple Retail Store, or participate in an online survey, we =
may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address,=
 phone number, email address, contact preferences, and credit card informat=
ion.<br>
<br>
=E2=96=A0When you share your content with family and friends using Apple pr=
oducts, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to join you o=
n Apple forums, Apple may collect the information you provide about those p=
eople such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.<br>
<br>
=E2=96=A0In the U.S., we may ask for your Social Security number (SSN) but =
only in limited circumstances such as when setting up a wireless account an=
d activating your iPhone or when determining whether to extend commercial c=
redit.<br>
<br>
How we use your personal information<br>
<br>
=E2=96=A0The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted o=
n Apple=E2=80=99s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcom=
ing events. It also helps us to improve our services, content, and advertis=
ing. If you don=E2=80=99t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out a=
nytime by updating your preferences.<br>
<br>
=E2=96=A0We also use personal information to help us develop, deliver, and =
improve our products, services, content, and advertising.<br>
<br>
=E2=96=A0From time to time, we may use your personal information to send im=
portant notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our =
terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to y=
our interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these communic=
ations.<br>
<br>
=E2=96=A0We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as=
 auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Apple=E2=80=99s products,=
 services, and customer communications.<br>
<br>
=E2=96=A0If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we m=
ay use the information you provide to administer those programs.<br>
<br>
Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information<br>
<br>
We also collect non-personal information =E2=88=92 data in a form that does=
 not permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect=
, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The=
 following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect an=
d how we may use it:<br>
<br>
=E2=96=A0We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code,=
 area code, unique device identifier, location, and the time zone where an =
Apple product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior an=
d improve our products, services, and advertising.<br>
<br>
=E2=96=A0We also may collect information regarding customer activities on o=
ur website, MobileMe service, and iTunes Store and from our other products =
and services. This information is aggregated and used to help us provide mo=
re useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our=
 website, products, and services are of most interest. Aggregated data is c=
onsidered non-personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.=
<br>
<br>
If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the com=
bined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it=
 remains combined.<br>
<br>
Cookies and Other Technologies<br>
<br>
Apple=E2=80=99s website, online services, interactive applications, email m=
essages, and advertisements may use =E2=80=9Ccookies=E2=80=9D and other tec=
hnologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us be=
tter understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our website people ha=
ve visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements =
and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other techn=
ologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet P=
rotocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal infor=
mation by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal informatio=
n. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with =
personal information, we treat the combined information as personal informa=
tion for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
Apple and its partners use cookies and other technologies in mobile adverti=
sing services to control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ad=
s that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campai=
gns. If you do not want to receive ads with this level of relevance on your=
 mobile device, you can opt out by accessing the following link on your dev=
ice: http://oo.apple.com. If you opt out, you will continue to receive the =
same number of mobile ads, but they may be less relevant because they will =
not be based on your interests. You may still see ads related to the conten=
t on a web page or in an application or based on other non-personal informa=
tion. This opt-out applies only to Apple advertising services and does not =
affect interest-based advertising from other advertising networks.<br>
<br>
Apple and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember =
personal information when you use our website, online services, and applica=
tions. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with Apple more c=
onvenient and personal. For example, knowing your first name lets us welcom=
e you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store. Knowing your country =
and language =E2=88=92 and if you are an educator, your school =E2=88=92 he=
lps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience. Knowing so=
meone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or us=
ed a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communicati=
ons more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information, =
product serial numbers, and information about your computer or device helps=
 us register your products, personalize your operating system, set up your =
MobileMe service, and provide you with better customer service.<br>
<br>
If you want to disable cookies and you=E2=80=99re using the Safari web brow=
ser, go to Safari preferences and then to the Security pane to disable cook=
ies. On your Apple mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, and then to =
the Cookies section. For other browsers, check with your provider to find o=
ut how to disable cookies. Please note that certain features of the Apple w=
ebsite will not be available once cookies are disabled.<br>
<br>
As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and s=
tore it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addr=
esses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referrin=
g and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.<=
br>
<br>
We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the=
 site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic =
information about our user base as a whole. Apple may use this information =
in our marketing and advertising services.<br>
<br>
In some of our email messages, we use a =E2=80=9Cclick-through URL=E2=80=9D=
 linked to content on the Apple website. When customers click one of these =
URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destin=
ation page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us dete=
rmine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our cu=
stomer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you sho=
uld not click text or graphic links in the email messages.<br>
<br>
Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read,=
 and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information=
 to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.<br>
<br>
Disclosure to Third Parties<br>
<br>
At times Apple may make certain personal information available to strategic=
 partners that work with Apple to provide products and services, or that he=
lp Apple market to customers. For example, when you purchase and activate y=
our iPhone, you authorise Apple and its carrier to exchange the information=
 you provide during the activation process to carry out service. If you are=
 approved for service, your account will be governed by Apple and its carri=
er=E2=80=99s respective privacy policies. Personal information will only be=
 shared by Apple to provide or improve our products, services and advertisi=
ng; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.<=
br>
<br>
Service Providers<br>
<br>
Apple shares personal information with companies who provide services such =
as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, de=
livering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing c=
ustomer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and =
conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are o=
bligated to protect your information and may be located wherever Apple oper=
ates.<br>
<br>
Others<br>
<br>
It may be necessary =E2=88=92 by law, legal process, litigation, and/or req=
uests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your count=
ry of residence =E2=88=92 for Apple to disclose your personal information. =
We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purpose=
s of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importan=
ce, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.<br>
<br>
We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure =
is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our =
operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger=
, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to th=
e relevant third party.<br>
<br>
Protection of Personal Information<br>
<br>
Apple takes precautions =E2=80=94 including administrative, technical, and =
physical measures =E2=80=94 to safeguard your personal information against =
loss, theft, and misuse, as well as against unauthorised access, disclosure=
, alteration, and destruction.<br>
<br>
Apple online services such as the Apple Online Store and iTunes Store use S=
ecure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal inform=
ation is collected. To make purchases from these services, you must use an =
SSL-enabled browser such as Safari, Firefox, or Internet Explorer. Doing so=
 protects the confidentiality of your personal information while it=E2=80=
=99s transmitted over the Internet.<br>
<br>
When you use some Apple products, services, or applications or post on an A=
pple forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal informati=
on you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used =
by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to sub=
mit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email addres=
s in a forum posting, that information is public. Please take care when usi=
ng these features.<br>
<br>
Integrity and Retention of Personal Information<br>
<br>
Apple makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, com=
plete, and up to date. We will retain your personal information for the per=
iod necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unles=
s a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.<br>
<br>
Access to Personal Information<br>
<br>
You can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accur=
ate, complete, and up to date by logging in to your account at https://appl=
eid.apple.com/. For other personal information, we make good faith efforts =
to provide you with access so you can request that we correct the data if i=
t is inaccurate or delete the data if Apple is not required to retain it by=
 law or for legitimate business purposes. We may decline to process request=
s that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effo=
rt, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for whi=
ch access is not otherwise required by local law. Access, correction, or de=
letion requests can be made to the regional Privacy email addresses.<br>
<br>
Children<br>
<br>
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If=
 we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under =
13 we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
Location-Based Services<br>
<br>
To provide location-based services on Apple products, Apple and our partner=
s and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, includin=
g the real-time geographic location of your Apple computer or device. This =
location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally i=
dentify you and is used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide =
and improve location-based products and services. For example, we may share=
 geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their lo=
cation services.<br>
<br>
Some location-based services offered by Apple, such as the MobileMe =E2=80=
=9CFind My iPhone=E2=80=9D feature, require your personal information for t=
he feature to work.<br>
<br>
Third-Party Sites and Services<br>
<br>
Apple websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to t=
hird-party websites, products, and services. Our products and services may =
also use or offer products or services from third parties =E2=88=92 for exa=
mple, a third-party iPhone app. Information collected by third parties, whi=
ch may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed=
 by their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy pr=
actices of those third parties.<br>
<br>
International Users<br>
<br>
Information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around t=
he world as described in this Privacy Policy. Apple abides by the =E2=80=9C=
safe harbor=E2=80=9D framework set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce=
 regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information colle=
cted by organizations in the European Economic Area and Switzerland. Learn =
more about the U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor Program.<br>
<br>

 member state of the European Economic Area (EEA) is jointly controlled by =
Apple Sales International in Cork, Ireland, and Apple UK Limited in Uxbridg=
e, United Kingdom. Personal information collected in the EEA when using iTu=
nes is controlled by iTunes SARL in Luxembourg.<br>
